# sed

GNU docs -> https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html

- Stand input = standard input stream, etcâ€¦

- Used for basic transformation on streams

- `type -a sed` ðŸ‘‰ sed is command, it is stand alone utility and not a shell built in

- `man sed` ðŸ‘‰ to view documentation

- Substitute command `sed "s/[search-pattern]/replacement-string/" [File to execute this command on]`
	
  - it does not alter the content of the file yet, it only send the output to STDout

- case sensitive my default

  - `i` flag to ignore string, usage `sed 's/search-pattern/replacement-string/i' [filename]` - we also use capital `I`.

- In case of multi line text it searches for text line by line and replaces its first match and then moves on

  - that is if there are two matches in a line it will replace only the first match

  - `g` - global replace to replace all the matches `sed â€™s/search-pattern/replacement-string/g' [filename]` 

  - If we want only a particular match to be replace we can use the number flag like 1, 2, 3â€¦etc

- we can write to new file using the `>` operation

  - `-i`: for inline editing. Append something to `-i` flag to create a backup file and replace inline for original file. Example: `sed -i.bak 's/search-pattern/replacement-string/' [filename]`

- Any character following the `s` can be used as delimiter 

  - ex: `sed â€™s#/home/json/#/something#`  , here `#` is used a delimiter.

- Delete the content using `d` command

  - to delete the line containing **this** -  `sed â€˜/this/dâ€™ [filename]`

- Multiple sed 

  - seperate each with semicolon - `sed â€˜/^#/d ; /^$/d' [filename]`

  - using `-e` option one for each sed operation

    - `sed -e â€˜/^#/dâ€™ -e â€˜/^$/dâ€™ [filename]`

- Run sed command from a file: (a file has all the sed commands we want to execute)

  - Example scripts.sed file to be

```
/^#/d
/^$/d
```

  - We can run sed from this file using `-f` flag - `sed -f script.sed [filename to execute sed on]`

- To execute only against single line in the file

  - `sed â€˜2 s/apahe/httpd/â€˜ [filename]`
